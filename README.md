**Felgines, Rymen, Martins et al. (2024)** *Nature Communications*  
“CLSY docking to Pol IV requires a conserved domain critical for small RNA biogenesis and transposon silencing.”   
Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54268-0  
Public analysis repo (project-wide): https://github.com/toddblev/Felgines_Rymen_Martins_2024

## What I did (Supplementary Fig. 6)
For Supplementary Fig. 6, I produced the **merged siRNA-seq analysis** by integrating **three independent Arabidopsis smRNA-seq datasets**:
- **Two previously published datasets** (from Zhou et al. 2018 and Zhou et al. 2022; I generated the libraries for the 2022 study)
- **One new dataset** generated for the 2024 paper (I generated the libraries and performed the bioinformatic analysis)

I used the lab’s standard siRNA-seq processing workflow and added custom steps to harmonize outputs across studies, enabling comparison in a single figure.

Note: The upstream project repository intentionally remains minimal and does not include the custom merge code I wrote for this cross-study integration.

## Data sources (public accessions)
The merged figure integrates data from these public series:
